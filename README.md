# Facial-movement-based-mouse-control
Run the main .ipynb file in your jupyter notebook. 
Wait for a few moments for the background to calibrate.
Upon the successfull calibration, move your head left for left mouse movement and move right for the right mouse movement.
For the left click, blink the eye and the link will be clicked.

The project uses win32 api to control the motion of the mouse with respect to head and hence won't run on Linux, Mac and operating systems other than Windows.
